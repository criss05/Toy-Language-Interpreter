# ToyLanguageInterpreter
This Java-based interpreter processes user-input operations using custom-built data structures and types. It features a GUI for easy interaction and supports arithmetic computations, variable assignments, and more. Developed as a faculty project, it showcases concepts in language design and software engineering.


# First Steps
This Java-based interpreter models a custom programming language with user-defined data structures (stack, map, list) and data types (int, bool, string). It supports statements like assignment, conditionals, no-op, print, and variable declaration, along with expressions for logic, relations, arithmetic, variables, and values. The project includes a program state to manage the execution stack, variable table, and output list. Actions are controlled by a central controller, and a console-based view allows users to interact with the interpreter. The project is organized in a repository that handles program states and action execution.
